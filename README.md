# Clickteam-Fusion-CSV-to-INI

### What is this?

This was a script I created while working with the Clickteam fusion 2.5 engine.

The script converts data from a CSV file to an INI file. This is only plain text format that the engine supports. (I recommend writing something to convert the ini to an array file)

You will need to edit it to fit your need particularly.

The main aim is to make sure you open the file you want to convert, save that to an array then loop through that array and write it to the file.

Hope it makes your lives easier, stay safe!
